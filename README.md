# music-embedding-retrieval

**music-embedding-retrieval** is a focused learning project exploring how **musical ideas can be represented, compared, and retrieved using machine learning concepts**.

The project sits at the intersection of **music, embeddings, and retrieval systems**, and is designed as a practical way to understand how modern generative music systems reason about similarity, structure, and context.

This repository documents my learning process as I study and experiment with these ideas in a transparent, hands-on way.

## Why This Project

Generative music systems don’t start with sound generation alone — they start with **representation**.

Before a model can generate music, it must be able to:
- Represent musical structure numerically
- Compare musical ideas
- Retrieve relevant patterns or phrases
- Understand similarity in a meaningful way

This project focuses on those foundations.

## What I’m Studying

### Musical Representation
- Symbolic representations of music (e.g. pitch, rhythm, intervals)
- Feature extraction from simple musical data (MIDI or structured sequences)
- Tradeoffs between expressive richness and computational simplicity

---

### Embeddings & Similarity
- Converting musical features into vector representations
- Measuring similarity between musical phrases
- Understanding why certain musical ideas cluster together
- Exploring the limitations of different representations

---

### Retrieval Systems
- Building small retrieval pipelines over embedded musical data
- Querying musical ideas by similarity
- Evaluating results qualitatively and analytically
- Understanding how retrieval supports generative systems

## How This Project Is Built

This project prioritizes **clarity and learning over scale**.

- Small, inspectable datasets
- Simple models and representations
- Clear separation between data, embeddings, and retrieval logic
- Experiments designed to reveal *why* something works or fails

Where appropriate, I use **AI tools as learning companions** — to ask questions, test ideas, review assumptions, and iterate faster — while keeping the system design, reasoning, and decisions intentional and my own.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Curiosity about ML fundamentals applied to music
- Comfort moving between music theory and technical representation
- System-level thinking around embeddings and retrieval
- An honest, disciplined learning approach using AI as a support tool, not a shortcut

This repository is meant to show **how I think and learn**, not just final outputs.

## Project Status

🚧 **In active development**

Planned next steps:
- Expand musical feature representations
- Compare different similarity metrics
- Visualize embedding spaces
- Connect retrieval outputs to simple generative experiments
